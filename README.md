### Cozy Scavenger Hunt Game - Tech Academy Internship Project

**Overview**

This project was developed as part of my internship at the Tech Academy, where I had the opportunity to apply my skills in game development using Unreal Engine. The goal was to create an engaging and immersive scavenger hunt game with a cozy ambiance, showcasing my proficiency in various aspects of game design and development. I invested time in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly UI that complements the cozy ambiance of the game. Each element, from buttons to progress indicators, is carefully designed to enhance the overall aesthetic and ensure a smooth interaction for players.
